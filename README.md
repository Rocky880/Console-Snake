A project for my A-Level computer science where you are marked on using a range of different techniques
including: switch case statements, if else ladders, while loops.
I developed further than the project required by utilising functions and 2d arrays to position the snake and cherries.
In this project I encountered difficulties with the fact c sharp is a reference language when i tried to create a 
temporary map to be edited within a local scope. To fix this I had to learn the Array.copy method. I also found it interesting using non-standard data types such as (int,int) to store co-ordinates of snakes and then creating a list for this data type, this was new to me and i believe this knowledge will be valuable and help me in other projects i am yet to do.
